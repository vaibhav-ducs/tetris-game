# About
A basic implementation of tetris using React.js

# Known Issues
  * As per the pre-defined word set, the game currently just bring the blocks of size same as word length, but failed to display name over the blocks
  * Scoring mechanism is not yet maintained properly. Here, when a complete row in the grid is filled then only it increment the scores
  * UI is also basic as of now, need improvements.
